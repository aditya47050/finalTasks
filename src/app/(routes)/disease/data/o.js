<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The root cause of obesity is not restricted to a single cause but many different factors. The leading factors that contribute to obesity are lack of exercise, excessive calorie intake, genetics, emotional stress, and sedentary lifestyle.&nbsp;<br><br>Obesity is also caused by energy imbalance (between energy intake and expenditure). This means that there is more food energy coming in than going out. If this continues, the person will gain weight until they are obese or overweight.&nbsp;<br><br>Many factors may contribute to obesity such as:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Genetic factors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Obesity tends to run in families. A child with a single obese parent has a 3-fold risk to become obese while a child with obese parents has a 10-times higher risk of obesity in future.<br><br>Genes can affect appetite and thus, how much food you consume. They also control how quickly the body burns calories at rest and during exercise. Genes also influence fat regulation and places of body fat accumulation, particularly fat in the abdomen and around the waist.&nbsp;<br><br>Very rarely, mutations in the following genes can cause obesity:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The ob gene:</strong> This gene controls the production of leptin, a hormone made by fat cells and placenta. Leptin controls weight by signaling the brain to eat less when body fat stores are very high. A mutation in the ob gene prevents leptin production and results in severe obesity in a very small number of children.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The gene for the melanocortin 4 receptor:</strong> Melanocortin 4 receptors are located mainly in the brain and play a key role in the regulation of energy. A mutation in this gene may account for obesity in 1 to 4% of children.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><br>However, it should be noted that families not only share genes but also environment, and separating the two factors is quite difficult. In other words, you could be genetically predisposed to being overweight, but your genes may not get activated if you have the right environment and lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Aging</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Obesity can occur at any age, even in children and teenagers. However, obesity becomes more common with age as the amount of muscle tissue decreases as you age. The result is a higher percentage of body fat and a lower basal metabolic rate (because muscle burns more calories). These changes also reduce the need for calories. So, if you don't consciously control what you eat and become more physically inactive as you age, you are most likely to gain weight.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Physical inactivity</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">A major factor that contributes to obesity is inactivity or lack of physical activity. Technological advances such as elevators, cars, remote controls, and online shopping have reduced the amount of calories burnt. More time is spent doing sedentary activities such as watching television, using the computer, smartphones, and playing video games.<br><br>Also, many people have desk jobs where they sit for hours without any breaks. This can lead to obesity in some people because their bodies are not burning enough calories when they are sitting at stretch for hours.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Unhealthy diet&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Modern day diet has significantly shifted to energy-dense foods, which have a large number of calories in a relatively small amount. Most of these foods contain more processed carbohydrates, and trans fat, and less fiber.&nbsp;<br><br>Fats, by nature, are energy dense. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, which in turn stimulate the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin promotes the growth of fat tissue and can cause weight gain.<br><br>More food advertisements promote high-fat, high-sugar, junk foods like biscuits, <em>namkeen</em>, candy, fizzy drinks, soda, and packaged foods than healthier options like whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Advertised products are designed to be cheap, have a long shelf-life and are specifically engineered to be addictive and irresistible. These convenience foods significantly contribute to obesity.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Frequency of eating</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">It has been observed that people who eat small meals four or five times daily, have lower cholesterol levels and lower weight and/or more stable blood sugar levels than people who eat big two or three large meals daily. Hence, large and fewer meals can predispose you to gain weight.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>6. Eating disorders</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The following eating disorders are associated with obesity:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Binge eating disorder </strong>is characterized by binging i.e.; eating large amounts of food during a short amount of time and usually by feeling guilty or out of control.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Night-eating syndrome </strong>involves not eating enough during the day and consuming a lot of food or calories in the evening. It also involves awakening in the middle of the night to eat.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>7. Medical conditions</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Certain medical conditions can lead to weight gain and eventually might lead to obesity. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cushing syndrome </strong>is caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. It mostly causes fat to accumulate in the face (called moon face), and behind the neck (called a buffalo hump).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https:///diseases/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-106?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_causes_3_direct_link_0"><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</strong></a> causes obesity in affected women. Levels of testosterone and other male hormones are increased, which causes fat to accumulate in the waist and abdomen.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https:///diseases/hypothyroidism-138?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_causes_3_direct_link_1"><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong></a> makes the body use less of the energy that one eats as food. The extra energy is more likely to be stored in the body as fat leading to obesity.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Insulin resistance </strong>is a condition which acts as a precursor for developing <a href="https:///diseases/type-2-diabetes-mellitus-105?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_causes_3_direct_link_2"><strong>type 2 diabetes</strong></a> and can also predispose to obesity.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https:///diseases/osteoarthritis-198?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_causes_3_direct_link_3"><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></a> causes joint pain that may lead to reduced physical activity and thereby cause obesity.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition, present at birth that causes uncontrolled hunger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>8. Certain drugs</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Many drugs used to treat certain diseases increase the risk of weight gain. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Antidepressants</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Antiseizure drugs, such as <a href="https:///generics/carbamazepine-209505?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_causes_3_direct_link_4">carbamazepine</a></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Antihypertensives such as beta-blockers</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Corticosteroids</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Some anti-diabetics</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Oral contraceptives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><br>If this issue concerns you, you should discuss your medications with your doctor rather than discontinuing them, as this could have serious side-effects.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>9. Pregnancy and menopause</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Gaining weight during pregnancy is normal and necessary. However, some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may predispose to the development of obesity. Having several children close together may compound the problem.&nbsp;<br><br>If a pregnant woman is obese or smokes, weight regulation in the child can be disturbed, leading to weight gain during childhood and later.<br><br>Many women tend to gain weight after menopause. This weight gain may result from reduced activity and hormonal changes may cause fat to be redistributed and accumulated around the waist.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>10. Gut microbiota</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Normally, the gut bacteria or gut flora help in digestion of food among other functions. However, an altered gut microenvironment such as long term use of antibiotics, may increase the risk of obesity. Changes in the number and types of bacteria in the digestive system may change how the body processes food.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>11. Exposure to chemicals</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Obesogens are chemicals that disrupt normal development and metabolism. Being exposed to obesogens early in life can increase the risk of developing obesity. These include cigarette smoke, bisphenol A, air pollution, flame retardants, phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>12. Psychological factors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Many people eat excessively in response to emotions such as boredom, sadness, <a href="https:///diseases/stress-749?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_causes_3_direct_link_5">stress</a>, <a href="https:///diseases/anxiety-69?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_causes_3_direct_link_6">anxiety</a> or anger. Adverse childhood events or a childhood history of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse are also associated with a higher risk of obesity.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>13. Lifestyle factors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Sleep deprivation or lack of the right amount of sleep can result in weight gain. Sleeplessness results in hormonal changes that increase appetite and cravings for energy-dense foods.<br><br>Cessation of smoking usually results in weight gain. When nicotine is stopped, people tend to eat more food, and their metabolic rate decreases, so that fewer calories are burned. As a result, body weight may increase, sometimes leading to obesity.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>14. Socioeconomic factors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Obesity and socioeconomic issues are also related. Lack of money to buy healthy foods or familiarity with healthy ways of cooking can increase the risk of obesity. So does lack of safe places to walk or exercise.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="diagnosis" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2 dir="ltr">Diagnosis Of Obesity</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><br>Obesity is a disease that is diagnosed by a physician who will measure the patient's height, weight, and body mass index. The physician may also do a physical examination, a laboratory test for thyroid function, and other tests to diagnose the cause of obesity.<br><br>There are different methods for diagnosing obesity.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Body mass index (BMI)</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The most common way to diagnose obesity is body mass index (BMI). It is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. If your BMI is greater than 30 kg/m2, you are considered obese. Being overweight or obese increases the chance of various diseases and chronic conditions.&nbsp;<br><br>The BMI categorizes people as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Underweight</strong>: &lt; 18.5 kg/m2</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Normal weight:</strong> 18.5-24.9 kg/m2</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Overweight:</strong> 25-29.9 kg/m2</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Obese: </strong>30-34.9 kg/m2</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Morbidly obese:</strong> 35-39.9 kg/m2</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><br>But, BMI is considered as an old way of diagnosing obesity because this doesn’t give accurate results for tall people or individuals with a lot of muscle mass.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Waist circumference</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The new way to diagnose obesity is by measuring waist size (waist circumference) instead of BMI. This method is more accurate than BMI because it doesn’t rely on height or muscle mass. Waist circumference greater than 40 inches (102 centimeters) in men and 35 inches (89 centimeters) in women is diagnosed as being obese. People with a larger waistline are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, <a href="https:///diseases/stroke-181?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_diagnosis_4_cta_link_0">stroke</a>, and cancer.&nbsp;<br><br>Obesity is not the same as being overweight. If someone has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more they are classified as obese, whereas someone with a BMI of 27-29.9 will be classified as overweight. <br><br><strong>Read more about overweight, obese, morbidly obese: know the difference.<br><a contenteditable="false" href="https:///articles/overweight-obese-morbidly-obese-know-the-difference/?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_diagnosis_4_cta_link_0"><button class="tinymceButton">Click Here To Read</button></a><br></strong></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Lab tests</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Many lab tests can be done to diagnose obesity. In most cases, you will need to go through an examination from your doctor or have blood work done. You may also have to take some steps before going through the testing process so that you are prepared for the results of the test.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<br>In the past few years, there has been a rise in obesity rates all around the world. That's why it's so important to be educated on how we can prevent this from happening and lower the rates of obesity. The question of how to prevent obesity is a difficult one in this modern day. Many factors contribute to the onset and progression of obesity. It’s not an easy problem to solve, but there are ways we can prevent or at least lessen it.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Dietary changes</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Healthier food choices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Safe and practical long-term weight reduction and maintenance diet needs to include balanced, nutritious foods to avoid vitamin deficiencies and other diseases of malnutrition.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Eat the rainbow diet which is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, lean proteins like fish, chicken breast or vegetable protein like soy. Low-fat or fat-free dairy, which is rich in Vitamin D, should also be included in the diet.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Eat ‘low energy density' foods which contain relatively few calories per unit weight. For example, you can consume a large amount of cucumbers or carrots without taking in many calories. These foods reduce hunger pangs and make you full on less.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Eat foods with a low glycemic index to keep insulin spikes in check.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Switch to healthy fats such as monounsaturated fats (olive and canola oil) and polyunsaturated fats (deep-sea fish and vegetable oil)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>Cutting down calories</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">The first step is to review and record how many calories you normally consume. Usually 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men are recommended for every day.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Your doctor/dietician/nutritionist can help you in guiding your daily calorie intake. It is also important to educate yourself in reading food labels and estimating calories and serving sizes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>Restricting certain foods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Avoid or limit sugar intake. Sugar in any form like table sugar, sweets, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, cakes, muffins, sugar sweetened beverages like fizzy drinks, packaged juices, and packaged flavored milk is detrimental for health.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Limit ‘energy dense foods'. These food items generally have a high calorie value in a small amount. They are high in saturated or trans fats and simple sugars.&nbsp; Examples include red meat, deep fried foods, packaged foods, sweets, cookies, cakes, pastries, butter, and high-fat salad dressings.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Avoid empty calories which are foods that provide calories but almost no nutrition such as alcohol, soft drinks, soda and many packaged high-calorie snack foods like biscuits and <em>namkeen</em>.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Avoid food items containing harmful fats such as saturated and trans fats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>Healthier lifestyle habits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Eat small, regular meals and limit or carefully choose snacks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Never skip breakfast as it can lead to consuming too many calories later in the day.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Be wary of quick fixes. Do not get tempted by crash, fad or popular diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. They might help in the short term, but you're likely to regain the lost weight when you stop the diet.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Consistency is the key. To lose weight and keep it off, one must adopt healthier habits that can be maintained for a long term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Increased physical activity</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Exercising can help people lose weight in a healthy way and keep it off. People who do not exercise while dieting are more likely to regain the weight they lose. Compared to those who are inactive, physically active people have stronger muscles and better cardiovascular fitness. They also usually have lower body fat and stronger bones. A few exercise recommendations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Indulge in 20 to 30 minutes of moderate exercise five to seven days a week, and if possible, daily. These include stationary bicycling, walking briskly, jogging, swimming, biking, tennis, skating, and skiing.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Exercise can be phased out over small sessions of 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid any injury or excessive fatigue. Over time, build up to 30-60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Daily activitie such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and walking instead of driving can burn a considerable number of calories.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">It is never too late to start exercising. Even elderly individuals can improve their strength and balance by exercising regularly. However, it is always wise to consult your healthcare provider for evaluation of any risks associated with exercising.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Parents should also get their children involved in low-intensity physical exercise that will last 20 to 30 minutes per day. This might help children to maintain a healthy weight throughout childhood and adulthood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Get enough sleep</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">You need to make sure that you are getting enough sleep each night because if you’re not sleeping enough, it can affect your metabolism and appetite control, which can lead to weight gain or obesity over time.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Reduce screen time</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Adults and children spend over 7 hours a day on screen time. This includes sitting or laying down with a smartphone, tablet, watching TV, playing video games and even doing office work on the laptops.<br><br>Too much screen time is a strong obesity risk factor. It's associated with low physical activity and poor sleep which predisposes to weight gain. Television also exposes one to incessant marketing of unhealthy packaged foods and sugary drinks.<br><br><strong>PARENTS! <br><br>Here are a few valuable tips to manage your children’s dietary habits and avoid common traps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Don't reward your children for good behavior or try to stop bad behavior with candies, chocolates or treats. Junk food used as positive or negative reinforcer can make the child value it more than healthier options.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Don't talk about ‘bad foods’ or completely ban all sweets and junk food. Children might rebel and overeat forbidden foods outside the home or sneak them in on their own. Idea is to serve healthy foods most of the time and offer treats once in a while.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Don't have an empty-plate policy. If children feel full, don't force them to keep eating. Reinforce the idea that they should eat only when they're hungry and stop when they're full.</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr"><br>Most patients will visit their primary care physician first. The primary care physician will rule out any underlying health conditions and provide a diagnosis or refer you to a specialist depending on the severity of your obesity.<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">If you're overweight and want to get back to a healthy weight, you must talk to a <strong>physician</strong>. He/she can diagnose the cause of your obesity and help you develop a customized treatment plan.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">If your weight gain is due to an underlying hormonal issue, then you must visit an <strong>endocrinologist</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">If you suffer from excessive weight due to overeating or eating unhealthy food, then the doctor that will be most helpful for you is a <strong>psychiatrist or a health coach.</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">If it is that your body does not properly use the calories from food, then the doctor who will be most helpful for you is a <strong>dietitian</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Some doctors may only treat severe or mild forms of obesity. For example, <strong>bariatric surgeons </strong>will only perform surgeries for people with extreme obesity.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><br>Obesity is a chronic and complex disease with significant health consequences. In case, lifestyle changes don't work, then consult your healthcare provider to evaluate the need for the next level of treatment -- medications and surgery.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Medications</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The drugs that are used to treat obesity are called anti-obesity drugs. These drugs work by decreasing appetite, increasing the rate at which the person burns calories, or decreasing how much food is absorbed from one’s diet. The following drugs are prescribed for obesity:<br><br><strong>1. <a href="https:///generics/orlistat-210392?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_0">Orlistat</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Orlistat works by reducing the absorption of fats from food in the gut. It also reduces appetite and promotes a feeling of fullness leading to weight loss. It is a prescription medication that can be taken for a long time.<br><br><strong>2. <a href="https:///generics/rimonabant-210636?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_1">Rimonabant</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Rimonabant is a cannabinoid receptor agonist. It has been found to reduce appetite and body weight and to cause a reduction in the body mass index (BMI).<br><br><strong>3. Phentermine</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Phentermine is a drug that slows down the activity of your brain to reduce your appetite. It also increases the amount of energy that you expend during physical activity, which means that you will burn more calories than you usually would.<br><br><strong>4. <a href="https:///generics/lorcaserin-508760?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_2">Lorcaserin</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lorcaserin, on the other hand, helps suppress appetite and increase weight loss through serotonin activity in the brain.<br><br>These drugs are used in combination with behavioral therapy and other lifestyle changes to reduce weight gain or improve weight loss. One problem with these drugs is that they may lead to side effects like <a href="https:///diseases/nausea-587?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_3">nausea</a>, vomiting, <a href="https:///diseases/dizziness-909?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_4">dizziness</a>, dry mouth, etc.<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Recent Advances<br></strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>1. <a href="https:///generics/semaglutide-509803?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_5">Semaglutide:</a></strong> A medication that reduces appetite and improves blood sugar control. It has been shown to promote significant weight loss, making it a key treatment for those struggling with obesity.<br><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>2. <a href="https:///generics/tirzepatide-510715?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_6">Tirzepatide:</a></strong> Aids in weight loss by promoting satiety, helping you feel fuller for longer, and balancing energy intake. It also effectively controls blood sugar levels, making it a powerful option for obesity management.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Semaglutide vs. Tirzepatide</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Both Semaglutide and Tirzepatide aid in weight loss when combined with lifestyle changes through structured exercise and dietary modifications. However, studies show that Tirzepatide can lead to an additional 5% weight loss compared to Semaglutide, making it a more promising option for effective weight management.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both medications can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and dry mouth. <strong>Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new medication to ensure it is safe and suitable for your specific condition.<br><a contenteditable="false" href="https:///online-doctor-consultation?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_treatment_9_cta_link_0"><button class="tinymceButton">Book an Appointment</button></a></strong></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><br>Bariatric surgery</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This surgery reduces the size of the stomach so that it can’t hold as much food as before. Surgery for obesity may be suggested in the following obese patients:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Patients with a BMI more than 40&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Patients with a BMI more than 35 who have serious medical conditions like sleep apnea that would improve with weight loss</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><br>Currently, the following types of bariatric surgeries are advised:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Restrictive surgeries:</strong> These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach and slow down digestion.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Malabsorptive/restrictive surgeries:</strong> These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach and also bypass or remove some parts of the digestive system to reduce the absorption of food.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><br>Weight is frequently a very personal and sensitive subject because of our attitudes around body image. As a result, dealing with the issue of weight might be difficult. Overweight people typically have low self-esteem, so telling them they need to lose weight is the last thing they need. Instead, you may encourage them to join you in making healthier lifestyle choices.<br><br>Obesity, especially in women, can have a major impact on sexual quality of life. Obesity management that can improve self-esteem, sexuality, and overall quality of life includes:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><br>The key to managing obesity is being committed to making lifestyle changes. These changes can be difficult at first but they will eventually become second nature. It's important not to let the difficulties get in the way of your success because you are worth it!<br><br>Regular exercise can help people lose weight, as well as maintain a healthy weight. Exercise releases endorphins which make us feel good and eat less. Find an exercise that you enjoy doing or that you don’t mind doing. Some forms of exercise that are effective in reducing weight include aerobic exercises, strength training exercises, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT).<br><br><strong>Here is a quick look at some key aspects of obesity that every person should be aware of and why ending the weight stigma is the key to fight obesity.<br><a contenteditable="false" href="https:///articles/world-obesity-day-its-time-to-end-weight-stigma/?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Obesity_living_with_15_cta_link_0"><button class="tinymceButton">Tap To Read</button></a></strong></p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="faqs" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="flexColumn container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="l3Bold marginTop-8">Frequently Asked Questions</h2></div><div class="col-12 flexColumn marginTop-8"><div class="marginTop-16 style__header___3s4Ew style__pointer___1aMsp"><h3 class="flex justifyBetween marginTop-16 bodyBold">How does a person get obese?</h3></div><div class="style__section___KWiqo"><div class="flex justifyBetween alignCenter marginTop-8 textSecondary bodyRegular">Obesity develops from an energy imbalance—too few calories expended for the number of calories taken in—and from genetics, endocrine disorders, or reduced physical activity.

Obsessions are unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that can lead to distressing feelings. Compulsions are behaviors in response to obsessions to decrease distress.</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Symptoms vary from person to person and may include the continuous need to keep everything in the right manner, fear of contamination, repeated body movements, and a constant urge to correct things.</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">OCD can affect people of all ages and walks of life. Though the exact cause of OCD is unknown, risk factors like childhood trauma, genetic changes, family history, and certain changes in the brain structure are linked to the development of OCD.&nbsp;</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Treatment of OCD requires being mindful of one's thoughts and behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapy and medications can help manage the symptoms of OCD.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="fact_box" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="marginTop-8"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="l3Bold">Key Facts</h2></div><div class="flexColumn" id="factbox-expandable" style="max-height: 982px; overflow: hidden;"><div class="marginTop-16"><div class="alignCenter flex"><div class="col-1 style__icon___36Jld"><div class=""></div></div><div class="bodyBold col-3">Usually seen in</div><div class="flexColumn col-8 style__textBreak___3IcLh"><div class="bodyRegular"><ul>

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">OCD is multifactorial, and an inability to cope with uncertainty, an increased sense of responsibility along with overthinking can predispose those to obsessive-compulsive habits. Though the exact cause of OCD remains unknown, certain risk factors can increase your chances of developing OCD.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="risk_factors" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Risk Factors For Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is an array of factors that can lead to obsessive-compulsive disorder. OCD is characterized by obsessive and compulsive thoughts, and the risk factors can include:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Genetic mutations</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Research shows that there is a genetic predisposition to the development of OCD. Mutations (changes) in certain genes have been linked to OCD.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Family history</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Children with parents or siblings who have OCD are at a higher risk for developing OCD themselves. Research has shown the risk is as high as 45% to 65% in children and 27% to 45% in adults.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Environmental factors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Childhood trauma and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are interlinked. Studies show that the development of OCD symptoms can be due to trauma during childhood, however, more research is needed to understand this relationship better.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>Children get stressed too! </strong><strong>Know more about its triggers, symptoms, and what you should do as parents. </strong><strong>Enlighten yourself on childhood stress.<br><br><a contenteditable="false" href="https:///articles/childhood-stress-triggers-symptoms-and-how-parents-can-help/?utm_medium=Obsessive-compulsive%20disorder_risks_factor_3_cta_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page"><button class="tinymceButton">Tap here</button></a></strong></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Brain structure</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">There is some connection between OCD symptoms and abnormalities in certain areas of the brain, but it is not clear. It is hypothesized that problems in communication between the front part of the brain and deeper structures of the brain are attributed to OCD.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Streptococcal infections</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Certain studies have shown that earlier onset of OCD is seen after a Streptococcal infection known as PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections).</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="diagnosis" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Diagnosis Of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Diagnosis of any mental health condition can be tricky, it mainly relies on physical examination and psychological evaluation. Steps to help diagnose OCD may include:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Screening for OCD</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br>A. NICE guidelines:</strong> According to studies, the recently launched NICE guideline recommends six screening questions, that include:<strong><br></strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Do you wash or clean a lot?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Do you check things a lot?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Is there any thought that keeps bothering you that you would like to get rid of but can’t?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Do your daily activities take a long time to finish?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Are you concerned about orderliness or symmetry?</li>
<li dir="ltr">Do these problems trouble you?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>B. Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS):</strong> It is the most widely accepted tool to screen for OCD.The Y-BOCS rates on a scale from 0 to 40 (40 being the most severe of symptomatology). It ranks the individual, based on severity:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The time occupied by obsessive thoughts and compulsions</li>
<li dir="ltr">The interference of obsessive thoughts</li>
<li dir="ltr">The distress of obsessive thoughts</li>
<li dir="ltr">Resistance against obsessions</li>
<li dir="ltr">Degree of control over obsessive thoughts</li>
<li dir="ltr">The time occupied by compulsive behavior</li>
<li dir="ltr">The interference of compulsive behavior</li>
<li dir="ltr">The distress associated with compulsive behavior</li>
<li dir="ltr">Resistance against compulsive behavior</li>
<li dir="ltr">Degree of control over compulsive behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><br>2. Physical exam</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">It is done to help rule out other problems that could be causing the symptoms and to check for any related complications.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><br>3. Psychological evaluation</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This includes discussing your thoughts, feelings, symptoms, and behavior patterns. Recognition of obsessive-compulsive disorder may require direct questions. Also, your doctor may use criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><br>4. Lab tests</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">These are done to check for co-morbidities and other conditions and may include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><a href="https:///labs/test/complete-blood-count-1717?utm_medium=Obsessive-compulsive%20disorder_diagnosis_4_cta_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page&amp;wpsrc=Google%20Organic%20Search">Complete blood count (CBC)</a></li>

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">The treatment for OCD mainly focuses on improving the quality of life and taming the symptoms to manage daily activities. It mainly consists of the following:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">CBT is a type of talk therapy. The most used form of CBT in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder is exposure and response prevention (ERP). During this, the individuals are exposed to feared situations or images that focus on their obsessions. However, it can evoke anxiety in some cases.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Medications</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">A class of medications used to treat OCD is known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), typically used to treat depression. Research suggests that SSRIs and SRI like <a href="https:///generics/clomipramine-209630?utm_medium=Obsessive-compulsive%20disorder_treatment_8_cta_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page">clomipramine </a>are recommended as first-line agents for drug treatment. The best treatment for severe symptoms of OCD is a combination of CBT and SSRIs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SSRIs for the management of OCD include:</p>
<ul>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Neurosurgical treatment&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Surgical procedures like gamma ventral capsulotomy can be very effective for patients who do not respond to typical treatments. Deep brain stimulation, which involves an implanted device in the brain, has data to support its efficacy. However, it is still highly invasive and complex to manage.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Newer advancements</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A. Immunological therapies: </strong>Immunomodulatory therapy represents a new field, however, more research is required on this front. Some drugs used are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><a href="https:///generics/celecoxib-209549?utm_medium=Obsessive-compulsive%20disorder_treatment_8_cta_link_5&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Celecoxib</a></li>
<li dir="ltr">Nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>B. Pharmacogenetics:</strong> It studies how a person's genes respond to medications. Currently, several pharmacogenetic approaches have been conducted on the association between candidate genes with OCD and drug response.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>C. Psychotherapy: </strong>Recent advances have been made that focus on positive reinforcement, rather than asking the patient to face their fears, as in CBT, they include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rational emotive therapy:</strong> This therapy uses developed danger ideation reduction therapy (DIRT). It focuses on not undergoing exposure for patients with contamination fears.</li>
<li>
<strong>Third-wave therapies: </strong>This therapy uses mindfulness in OCD, which teaches individuals to focus on the world around them rather than their internal dialogue.</li>

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Management of OCD requires continuous efforts. Along with CBT and medications, there are a few alternative therapies that have shown promising results. They include:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1. Mindfulness</h3>
<p dir="ltr">It involves making a special effort to give your full attention to what is happening in the present moment, to what’s happening in your body, your mind, or your surroundings. Studies show that practicing mindfulness along with CBT and medications can help manage mild to moderate cases of OCD.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Hypnotherapy</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Hypnotherapy is a type of complementary therapy that uses hypnosis, which is an altered state of consciousness. Hypnosis is widely promoted as a treatment for anxiety, however, it may not be the best option for the treatment of OCD.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">CAT focuses on an individual's relationships. It is used in individuals living with depression, anxiety, or eating problems, who tend to self-harm, and with personal or relationship problems. CAT may help someone with OCD, but only to a certain extent.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Eye movement desensitization&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is a newer form of therapy that specifically focuses to help people with difficult traumatic memories. EMDR combines talking to a therapist about traumatic experiences with a technique where you make rapid rhythmic eye movements while recalling traumatic events to help you process them. Individuals with OCD can be considered for this therapy if they do not respond to CBT.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Interpersonal therapy (IPT)</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This therapy focuses on relationships with other people and how your thoughts, feelings, and behavior are affected by your relationships. However, there is little evidence that this therapy can work for individuals with OCD.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>6. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This therapy is an extension of CBT, that helps individuals experiencing borderline personality disorder. At this time there is little evidence to suggest it can help treat OCD any more than CBT.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>7. Emotional freedom technique (EFT)</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This therapy is commonly known as psychological acupressure, which aims to release emotional blockages within the body’s energy system.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="living_with" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Living With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having OCD or dealing with a family member or a friend can be challenging. It takes constant effort to keep a check on the symptoms, behaviors, and emotions. Here are a few tips that can help:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Things to do if you have OCD</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Living with OCD can be quite a task as you are trapped in your thoughts and emotions. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle by getting good quality sleep, eating healthy food, exercising, and spending time with others can help with overall mental health. Other important things include:</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Learning as much as you can about obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
<li dir="ltr">Knowing what triggers you and avoiding them</li>
<li dir="ltr">Focusing on your recovery goals</li>
<li dir="ltr">Joining support groups to understand how others with OCD are dealing with it</li>
<li dir="ltr">Finding outlets to release all the tension and energy healthily</li>
<li dir="ltr">Constantly reminding and motivating yourself</li>
<li dir="ltr">Keeping yourself busy&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Things to do if your loved ones have OCD</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Taking care of someone with OCD is a daily chore. They need daily affirmations and motivation. Other ways by which you can help someone with OCD inside:</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Constantly communicating with them</li>
<li dir="ltr">Creating a supportive environment</li>
<li dir="ltr">Recognizing and appreciating their efforts</li>
<li dir="ltr">Helping them with their medications and therapies</li>
<li dir="ltr">Keeping their daily routine normal</li>
<li dir="ltr">sensitively setting limits for them</li>
<li dir="ltr">Avoiding comparisons</li>
</ul>
<strong><br></strong>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>OCD in children: Tips for parents</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Parents generally keep on following the rituals to help their children feel less distressed. Unfortunately, this can unintentionally reinforce a child's symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Things to do if your child has OCD:</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Not performing a specific routine demanded by their child</li>
<li dir="ltr">Not changing your behavior to accommodate your child's demands</li>
<li dir="ltr">Trying not to excessively reassure your child</li>
<li dir="ltr">Taking a consistent approach to help your child with OCD</li>
<li dir="ltr">Not comparing them with other children</li>
<li dir="ltr">Giving your child rewards and brief praise provide on their achievements</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>Note: If you have OCD symptoms, seek your treatment and be open about it with your child.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Oral cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the mouth. It can affect the lips, cheeks, tongue, sinuses, and throat. Symptoms may include non-healing sores, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, and mouth pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oral cancer is the sixth most common cancer globally. India contributes to nearly one-third of cases and ranks second in oral cancer burden. It primarily affects men over 45 years. Key risk factors include tobacco, betel-quid chewing, alcohol, poor oral hygiene, and HPV infections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treatment of oral cancer includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. It can also include targeted therapy or immunotherapy in advanced cases. Early diagnosis, quitting tobacco or alcohol, and maintaining good oral hygiene help improve treatment success.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="fact_box" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="marginTop-8"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="l3Bold">Key Facts</h2></div><div class="flexColumn" id="factbox-expandable" style="max-height: 1240px; overflow: hidden;"><div class="marginTop-16"><div class="alignCenter flex"><div class="col-1 style__icon___36Jld"><div class=""></div></div><div class="bodyBold col-3">Usually seen in</div><div class="flexColumn col-8 style__textBreak___3IcLh"><div class="bodyRegular"><ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vital staining techniques: </strong>Tolonium chloride (also known as toluidine blue) staining is used to detect mucosal abnormalities in the oral cavity.&nbsp;<br><strong><br></strong></li>
<li><strong>Biopsy: </strong>A tissue sample is removed surgically from the suspected region and sent to the pathological laboratory for a detailed microscopic examination.<br><strong><br></strong></li>
<li><strong>Brush biopsy:</strong> In brush biopsy, cells from the oral lesion are obtained by scraping the surface mucosa.&nbsp;<br><strong><br></strong></li>
<li><strong>Exfoliative cytology:</strong> Exfoliative cytology is a simple and noninvasive diagnostic technique for the early detection of oral cancer.<br><strong><br></strong></li>

<h3 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Any kind of cancer requires multidisciplinary treatment that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, alone or in combination. Oral cancer treatment includes:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Surgical management&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Surgery for primary tumors: </strong>Surgery is advised for early-stage tumors, while advanced stages require surgery or chemoradiotherapy. Tumor removal methods depend on its location and extent.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Surgery for neck dissection:</strong> Neck dissection detects any spread of cancer in the early stage and removes the majority of affected lymph nodes.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Other surgeries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: circle;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Glossectomy (partial or total removal of your tongue)</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="2" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: circle;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Mandibulectomy (surgery for oral cancer in your jawbone)</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="2" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: circle;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Maxillectomy (removal of a part or all of the bony roof of your mouth).<br><br></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Surgery in case of recurrence</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Recurrence rates in the oral cavity are 30%, and Salvage (or 'rescue') surgery is used to refer to surgical treatment after failure of initial treatment.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Reconstruction</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The oral cavity is a complex site made up of several structures critical for speech, swallowing, and appearance.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">To be deemed successful, reconstruction should attempt to address all three, and it must be tailored to the site of the defect.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Radiation</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Radiation therapy uses X-rays to destroy or damage cancer cells, making them unable to proliferate. Radiotherapy is mainly used in patients with locally advanced oral cancer.<br><br><strong>Types of radiation therapy include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>External-beam radiation therapy:</strong> The most common type of radiation in which the radiation is given from a machine outside the body.&nbsp;<br><strong><br></strong></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Internal-beam radiation therapy: </strong>When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Brachytherapy involves the application of a radioactive source close to the tumor.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>5. Chemotherapy</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment with anti-cancer drugs that are injected into a vein or taken by mouth, which allows them to enter the blood and reach most parts of the body. Drugs used for chemotherapy include:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>Types of chemotherapy include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Adjuvant chemotherapy: </strong>It is given after surgery and is sometimes combined with radiation therapy. The goal is to kill cancer cells that might have been left behind at surgery because of the smaller size and also prevent recurrence.<br><strong><br></strong></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy: </strong>This is given before surgery with or without radiation to shrink some larger cancers to make surgery easier and remove less tissue..<br><strong><br></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>6. Chemoradiation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Chemoradiation is chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation.</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">

Early-stage cancers have a higher survival rate, while advanced cases may have a poorer outcome.
Like most forms of cancer, early diagnosis and treatment improve the chance that oral cancer will spread. Most people survive their cancer for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed.

It causes creamy white lesions, usually on your tongue or inner cheeks. Sometimes oral thrush may spread to the roof of your mouth, your gums or tonsils, or the back of your throat.<br><br>The symptoms of this condition include burning in the mouth, loss of taste, cracking at the corners of the mouth, pain or difficulty swallowing, a feeling of food getting stuck in the throat, and fever.<br><br>It can affect anyone, but it's more likely to occur in babies, older adults, and people with suppressed immune systems. Thrush in newborns and infants is common and usually not harmful and the outlook for mild cases of thrush is good. The prognosis for severe cases depends on the underlying cause and the status of the patient's immune system.&nbsp;<br><br>The best way to prevent this is by maintaining immaculate oral hygiene, maintenance of dentures in older patients, and regular visits to the dentist.<br><br>The treatment mainly consists of topical or systemic antifungal medications and milder can be managed with home remedies and over-the-counter antifungal mouthwashes and ointments. It is always necessary to diagnose the predisposing factors and treat the cause in case of recurrence.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="fact_box" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="marginTop-8"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="l3Bold">Key Facts</h2></div><div class="flexColumn" id="factbox-expandable" style="max-height: 1193px; overflow: hidden;"><div class="marginTop-16"><div class="alignCenter flex"><div class="col-1 style__icon___36Jld"><div class=""></div></div><div class="bodyBold col-3">Usually seen in</div><div class="flexColumn col-8 style__textBreak___3IcLh"><div class="bodyRegular"><ul>

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Though oral thrush is not a life-threatening condition, it is quite common and can have an effect on general well-being. Various risk factors of oral thrush include:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Local factors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>1. Saliva:</strong> Salivary gland dysfunction predisposes to oral candidiasis. Conditions affecting the quantity (like<a href="https:///diseases/xerostomia-910?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Oral thrush_risks_factor_5_cta_link_0"> xerostomia</a>) and quality of salivary secretions may lead to an increased risk of oral thrush.<br><br><strong>2. Dentures:</strong> They create a favorable environment for candida organisms to thrive. The majority of the people wearing complete dentures are predisposed to candida infection.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3. Topical medications:</strong> The use of topical or inhalational corticosteroids and overzealous use of antimicrobial mouthwashes can temporarily suppress local immunity and cause alterations in the oral flora, thereby increasing the risk of candidiasis.<br><br><strong>4. Smoking: </strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3593773/">Studies</a> suggest that smoking alone or in combination with other factors, significantly affects the oral candida environment in the mouth.<br><br><strong>Want to quit smoking?

Diet:</strong> Excessive intake of refined sugars, carbohydrates, and dairy products can enhance the growth of candida organisms by reducing the pH levels.<br><br><strong>Want to know more about healthy eating habits?<br><br></strong></p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Systemic factors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>1. Age:</strong> Extremes of age, like infancy or old age, may predispose to oral thrush due to immature or weakened immunity.<br><br><strong>2. Malnutrition:</strong> The deficiency of iron, essential fatty acids, folic acid, vitamins A and B6, magnesium, selenium, and zinc can help in the overgrowth of the candida species.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3. Medications:</strong> Prolonged use of drugs like broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppressants that cause<a href="https:///diseases/xerostomia-910?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Oral thrush_risks_factor_5_cta_link_2"> dry mouth (xerostomia)</a> create a favorable environment for candida to grow.<br><br><strong>4. Endocrine disorders:</strong> A more aggressive form of oral thrush is more prevalent in patients with endocrine dysfunctions such as <a href="https:///diseases/diabetes-693?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Oral thrush_risks_factor_5_cta_link_3">diabetes</a> and Cushing’s syndrome (a noncancerous benign tumor of the pituitary gland).<br><br><strong>5. Immunodeficiency: </strong>Conditions such as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome (SCID) that severely affect immunity are significant predisposing factors for candidiasis.<br><br><strong>6. Cancer: </strong>The host defense mechanisms are compromised by chemotherapy and radiotherapy administered for the treatment of cancer. This significantly reduces immunity and leads to oral thrush.<br><br><strong>7. Congenital conditions:</strong> Individuals affected by congenital conditions associated with the defective immune system are commonly predisposed to candida infections.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="flexColumn container-fluid widget-container"><div class="flex"><div class="col-10"><div class="l5SemiBold">Did you know?</div><div class="smallRegular textSecondary">Candidiasis and COVID-19 infections are interlinked.

<p dir="ltr"><br>Oral thrush is easily noticeable as a white patch in and around the mouth. To confirm the diagnosis or to rule out any other underlying health conditions your doctor will include:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Physical examination</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">To diagnose oral thrush, your doctor or dentist may examine your mouth to look at the lesions, where they are located, and if they are scrapable or not.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Blood tests</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Your doctor may sometimes suggest a blood test to look for certain conditions that may make you more likely to develop an oral thrush such as a deficiency of <a href="https:///generics/iron-212771?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Oral thrush_diagnosis_7_cta_link_0">iron</a>, <a href="https:///generics/vitamin-b12-508208?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Oral thrush_diagnosis_7_cta_link_1">vitamin B12</a>, or f<a href="https:///generics/folic-acid-209911?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Oral thrush_diagnosis_7_cta_link_2">olic acid</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>1. Histopathology examination:</strong> This consists of taking a small scraping of the active lesions to examine under a microscope.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>2. Biopsy: </strong>Biopsy specimens should in addition be sent for histopathological examination when chronic hyperplastic candidosis is suspected.<br><br><strong>3.

<p dir="ltr"><br>Oral thrush is not a very serious condition and it may be managed easily in healthy individuals. But, a main cause of concern is for immunocompromised patients, who are at a greater risk of a widespread disease leading to complications. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Dysphagia:</strong> This means difficulty in swallowing. The throat develops multiple white patches leading to pain while swallowing, burning or itching in the throat or back of the mouth.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Respiratory distress:</strong> Thrush can easily spread to other parts of your body, including the lungs which may lead to difficulty in breathing and distress.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Candidal esophagitis: </strong>Candidiasis in the esophagus (food pipe) is called esophageal candidiasis or candida esophagitis. This is a prevalent complication of oral thrush in those with HIV/AIDS.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Traditional Chinese medicine</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The use of Chinese herbs is a time-honored approach to strengthen the body and treat disease.

Although it can affect any joints, the knees, spine, hips, and hands are the most affected.</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">It is the fourth leading cause of disability globally that affects 10-15% of all adults above the age of 60 years. It is the most common joint disease in India with a prevalence of 22-39%. Before the age of 45, osteoarthritis is more common in men, and as age advances, women are more predisposed to the condition.</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">It is characterized by breakdown of the cartilage (the tissue that cushions the ends of the bones between joints), bony changes of the joints, deterioration of tendons and ligaments, and various degrees of inflammation of the joint lining (called the synovium). Progressive pain, stiffness, and joint deformities are the primary symptoms of the disease.&nbsp;</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Although there is no cure for the disease, medications, surgery, and alternative therapies can slow down disease progression and help patients lead comfortable and productive lives. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight also helps in slowing the progression of the disease.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="fact_box" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="marginTop-8"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="l3Bold">Key Facts</h2></div><div class="flexColumn" id="factbox-expandable" style="max-height: 1114px; overflow: hidden;"><div class="marginTop-16"><div class="alignCenter flex"><div class="col-1 style__icon___36Jld"><div class=""></div></div><div class="bodyBold col-3">Usually seen in</div><div class="flexColumn col-8 style__textBreak___3IcLh"><div class="bodyRegular"><ul>

</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A lot of factors are responsible for osteoarthritis, such as:<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Age-related degenerative changes</h3>
<p dir="ltr">With increasing age, there is normal wear and tear of the joints, cartilages, ligaments, and other soft tissues in the body. These degenerative changes occur in various joints making them stiff. Degeneration of the joints also leads to formation of osteophytes which are extra bony protrusions and are characteristic to osteoarthritic joints. These can lead to immense pain and stiffness. In advanced stages, joint deformities occur that can severely impact function and mobility.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>Heredity</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Genetic factors likely influence the formation of osteophytes and degeneration of joints. This is likely attributed to polymorphism in genes regulating the inflammatory pathways. For example, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is characterized by joint hypermobility, can contribute to osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>Environmental factors</h3>
<p dir="ltr">A poor posture, lack of exercise, obesity, occupational hazards, such as lifting heavy weights, previous trauma to the joints cause faster wear and tear of the joints, leading to osteoarthritis.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>Post menopause</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Decreased estrogen as experienced by post-menopausal women increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis as estrogen is protective of bone health specifically reducing oxidative stress to the cartilage.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="risk_factors" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2>Risk Factors For Osteoarthritis<br><br>

</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The treatment of osteoarthritis mainly involves medical management &amp; surgical management.<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Medical Management<br><br>
</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. NSAID Analgesics</strong>: These include medicines like <a href="https:///generics/ibuprofen-210020?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Ibuprofen</a>, <a href="https:///generics/diclofenac-209716?q=diclofena&amp;utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_1&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Diclofenac</a>, and <a href="https:///generics/paracetamol-210459?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_2&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Paracetamol</a> that help relieve pain and inflammation. These medicines must always be consumed with meals as taking them on an empty stomach can irritate the gastric lining.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>2. <a href="https:///drugs-therapeutic-classes/drug-class-347?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_3&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Narcotics</a>:</strong> This class of drugs may be required for more severe intensity pain, which is not relieved by the first line of medications. These tablets must be used only as prescribed by the physician as they are potentially habit-forming.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2010, the government (FDA) approved the use of duloxetine (Cymbalta) for chronic (long-term) musculoskeletal pain including from OA. This oral drug is not new. It also is in use for other health concerns, such as mood disorders, nerve pain and fibromyalgia.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>3. Muscle relaxants: </strong>These drugs help relieve the painful spasms and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis of the spine. One of the most commonly used drugs in this category is <a href="https:///generics/cyclobenzaprine-209668?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_4&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Cyclobenzaprine</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><br>4. Corticosteroids:</strong> This class includes medicine like <a href="https:///generics/prednisolone-210551?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_5&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Prednisolone</a> which may be prescribed for a short duration or even as an injection to help resist pain. Joint injections with corticosteroids (sometimes called cortisone shots) or with a form of lubricant called hyaluronic acid can give months of pain relief from OA. This lubricant is given in the knee, and these shots may help delay the need for a knee replacement by a few years in some patients.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>5. Topical analgesics &amp; sprays:</strong> Topical application of analgesic ointments and sprays can help with symptomatic pain relief.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>6. Medications for nerve pain:</strong> These are useful in providing relief from complications of osteoarthritis of the spine, such as radiating pain, tingling, numbness in the upper and lower limbs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br><strong>7. Supplements:</strong> Many over-the-counter nutrition supplements have been used for osteoarthritis treatment. Most lack good research data to support their effectiveness and safety. Among the most widely used are calcium, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. Fish oils are also known to have anti- inflammatory properties. However, their use has been established mainly in rheumatoid arthritis. To ensure safety and avoid drug interactions, consult your doctor or pharmacist before using any of these supplements</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>Surgical Management and Other Invasive Procedures<br><br>
</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Intra-articular Injections<br></strong>In cases of severe pain that does not respond to medications, a <a href="https:///generics/hydrocortisone-210005?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_6&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Hydrocortisone </a>injection may be given in the joint to offer quick relief. <a href="https:///generics/hyaluronic-acid-212413?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_treatment_8_direct_link_7&amp;utm_source=disease_page">Hyaluronic Acid Injections</a> are given in the joint to help with joint lubrication.<br><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Alignment correction surgery<br></strong>Corrective surgeries like osteotomy, laminectomy, spinal fusion are performed in severe joint deformities that cause limitation of function and pain.<br><br></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Joint Replacement Surgery:</strong> <br>For severely damaged knees and hips, a prosthesis may be fitted, and the worn-out joints are completely replaced by mechanical joints. Though some of the joint changes are irreversible, most patients will not need joint replacement surgery.&nbsp;</p>

</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Osteoarthritis has a great impact on an individual’s quality of life. Severe, chronic, and debilitating pain may interfere with basic activities, such as walking, leading to restrictions in movements and travel. Often, chronic pain is a source of anxiety and depression in osteoarthritic patients, and they find themselves withdrawn from society and the community at large. Joining knee care and spine care clubs may help these patients deal with the degenerative changes and bond with others suffering similar pain.<br><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few lifestyle changes one can incorporate into their routine life to ease off joint pains, especially during winter.<br><br></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1. Supplement bone &amp; joint healthy foods</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Stock up dairy products and spend at least 15 minutes in sunlight daily to increase the intake of vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Include foods rich in omega-3 fats such as salmon, nuts, fish oil in your diet as these ease inflammation.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Foods rich in vitamin K are helpful because of its pain-soothing properties. Include greens in your meal such as spinach, fenugreek (methi), cabbage, kale, etc.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Foods rich in vitamin C halt cartilage loss associated with arthritis. Add juicy oranges, sweet red peppers, tomatoes, amla and other vitamin C-rich foods in your diet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">2. Exercise regularly</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Go for a 30-minute walk daily. If cold weather makes you lazy to go out in the mornings, go for an afternoon walk. Also, stretch your muscles as it helps maintain your mobility.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>3. Stay hydrated</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Drink plenty of water in winters as dehydration reduces flexibility and increases stiffness.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>4. Get a massage</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Massage therapy by a professional helps in relaxing the muscles around the painful joints, thereby reducing pain and making you more mobile.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>5. Cover Up</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Try to keep painful joints covered with a sleeve or wrap. Keeping them warm helps reduce pain and increases mobility. Using a <a href="https:///categories/health-conditions/pain-relief-32?utm_medium=Osteoarthritis_living_with_12_direct_link_0&amp;utm_source=disease_page">muscle relaxant gel</a> on the aching joints and then covering up has been seen to be very helpful.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>6. Use hot packs/ice packs</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Hot packs/hot baths/steam helps to soothe the painful joints. Heat stimulates blood flow, which brings healing nutrients to the affected area and inhibits the pain messages being sent to the brain.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<br>7. Take medication on time</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Do not forget to take your medications as advised by your doctor. If you suffer from chronic joint pain, consult your doctor for painkillers. Do not self-medicate. Also, go for regular doctor consultation, especially if your symptoms recur/worsen.</p>

</h3></div><div class="style__section___KWiqo"><div class="flex justifyBetween alignCenter marginTop-8 textSecondary bodyRegular">No, unfortunately osteoarthritis is not reversible. As it occurs due to degenerative changes, which are a part of the normal ageing process, it is not possible to either completely stop its progression or reverse the damage.

</h3></div><div class="style__section___KWiqo"><div class="flex justifyBetween alignCenter marginTop-8 textSecondary bodyRegular">To get pain relief in an aching joint, you may apply topical analgesic creams to the painful area. A heat pack or cold pack (as applicable) can also provide quick pain relief. You can even support the painful joint with a brace if advised by your doctor. If the pain is too severe, you may take an SOS pain medication such as paracetamol, after consultation with your doctor.
</div></div><div style="background: rgb(250, 250, 250); display: block; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 0px; height: 1px;"></div><div class="marginTop-16 style__header___3s4Ew style__pointer___1aMsp"><h3 class="flex justifyBetween marginTop-16 bodyBold">Should I use a heat pack or ice pack for my painful joints?
</h3></div><div class="style__section___KWiqo"><div class="flex justifyBetween alignCenter marginTop-8 textSecondary bodyRegular">The rule of the thumb is to use ice packs whenever there is an acute inflammation or injury to the joint and a heat pack in case of chronic pain, with no active inflammation. In case of osteoarthritis of joints, the pain is usually chronic and there is rarely a presence of acute inflammation. Hence, heat packs are more suitable to combat pain and stiffness.

</h3></div><div class="style__section___KWiqo"><div class="flex justifyBetween alignCenter marginTop-8 textSecondary bodyRegular">An ideal brace is neither too tight nor too loose. It should be tight enough that it provides support to your joint, but not too tight such that the blood circulation to the joint is hampered. Most braces nowadays come with manufacturer’s size charts. You must measure your knee or waist (as applicable) and select the size which suits your measurements. Whenever possible, try on the brace and check its fitting before buying it, to ensure that you get the correct size.

It refers to a condition which causes marked softening of the bones due to a decreased ability to harden or mineralize.&nbsp;<br><br>Bones are made up of various minerals, including calcium and phosphorus, that give structure and integrity to the bones. Vitamin D controls levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. An imbalance of these minerals which usually occurs due to deficiency of Vitamin D can interfere with bone health and can cause an individual to develop osteomalacia.&nbsp;<br><br>Osteomalacia can cause bone pain, muscle weakness, difficulty in walking, and an increased susceptibility to bone fractures. This condition is mostly seen in adults. In children, it is referred to as <a href="https:///diseases/rickets-920?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Osteomalacia_overview_direct_link_0">rickets</a>, which causes impaired mineralization at the bone growth plate. This results in softening and deformation of bones in children and limits their growth. Osteomalacia is different from osteoporosis. Though both can cause bones to fracture, osteomalacia is a problem with bones not hardening, while osteoporosis is the weakening of living bone caused when balance between bone loss and bone formation is disrupted.<br><br>Treatment for osteomalacia involves providing adequate Vitamin D and calcium, both of which are required to harden and strengthen bones, and treating the causing disorders.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="fact_box" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="marginTop-8"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="l3Bold">Key Facts</h2></div><div class="flexColumn" id="factbox-expandable"><div class="marginTop-16"><div class="alignCenter flex"><div class="col-1 style__icon___36Jld"><div class=""></div></div><div class="bodyBold col-3">Usually seen in</div><div class="flexColumn col-8 style__textBreak___3IcLh"><div class="bodyRegular"><ul>

<p dir="ltr"><br>Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by impaired mineralization of the bone matrix. Bone creation occurs by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals on the bone matrix. The causes include:</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Decreased production of Vitamin D</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Vitamin D plays an extremely important role in bone remodeling and is required for strengthening the bone. Some of the causes of decreased Vitamin D production are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Reduced sun exposure due to cold weather climates leading to low levels of Vitamin D .</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Darker skin and increased melanin hinder Vitamin D ultraviolet-B (UVB) light absorption.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Obesity can lead to increased removal of fat, which results in less calcium for activation of Vitamin D.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">In the elderly vitamin D production decreases as the storage of Vitamin D declines with age.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Decreased absorption of Vitamin D</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Malabsorptive of vitamin D can be due to syndromes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Crohn's disease:</strong> It is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation of the digestive tract, which can lead to abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and malnutrition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cystic fibrosis:</strong> It is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Celiac disease:</strong> It is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cholestasis: </strong>It is a liver disease that occurs when the flow of bile from your liver is reduced or blocked. Bile is fluid produced by your liver that aids in the digestion of food, especially fats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Surgical alteration:</strong> Like gastric bypass of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is associated with deficient absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Alterations in the metabolism of Vitamin D</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This can be due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Pregnancy is associated with decreased levels of calcidiol (a form of vitamin D), and a dose of 1000 to 2000 international units (IU) per day is identified as Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Liver diseases such as cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (inflammation of the liver characterized by fat accumulation in the liver) can lead to deficient production of calcidiol.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Chronic kidney disease leads to structural damage and loss of 1-alpha-hydroxylase, an enzyme required for the activation of Vitamin D.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder that causes your body to pass too much protein in your urine) leads to pathologic excretion of Vitamin D binding protein (DBP), which binds to serum calcidiol.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Low levels of phosphorous (hypophosphatemia) or calcium (hypocalcemia) in blood</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">It is seen in the following diseases:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Renal tubular acidosis such as seen in Fanconi syndrome alter calcium and other ion absorption and excretion.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), also known as oncogenic osteomalacia, is a rare acquired paraneoplastic disease (cancer caused due to auto-immune activity) characterized by hypophosphatemia and renal phosphate wasting.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Medications</strong></h3>

<h3 dir="ltr"><br><strong>History and physical examination</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">When evaluating for osteomalacia, a clinical history should include an understanding of a patient's family and surgical (like gastric bypass) history. Other relevant questions should focus on activity level, hobbies, diet, and assessment of socioeconomic status.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><br><strong>Blood tests</strong></h3>

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">The goals of therapy for vitamin D‐deficiency osteomalacia are to alleviate symptoms, promote fracture healing, restore bone strength, and improve quality of life while correcting the abnormalities. The treatment should focus on the healing of osteomalacia and the resolution of secondary hyperparathyroidism. It consists of:&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><br><strong>1. Maintaining PTH levels</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">There are no well‐established guidelines for this therapy. Most regimens targeted to maintain levels of serum 25OHD at &gt;30 ng/mL and PTH levels within the reference range. With effective therapy, clinical symptoms begin to improve within a few weeks; however, complete resolution of symptoms may take several months.&nbsp;<br><br>Following treatment, certain common findings are observed, like:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Increase of serum alkaline phosphatase that gradually decreases; in patients with prolonged Vitamin D deficiency</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Hyperparathyroidism may persist for a long time</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">In rare cases it may progress to hypercalcemic tertiary hyperparathyroidism</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, depending on the amount of osteoid accumulation, a striking increase in BMD is observed, as seen after curing of osteomalacia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Oral preparations of Vitamin D</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Therapy consists of vitamin D in the range following range:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">800 to 1200 IU daily oral doses&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">50 000 IU of native vitamin D weekly for 8 to 12 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 1000 to 2000 IU daily</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">10,000 − 50,000 IU may be necessary in cases of impaired GI absorption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Because these regimens may take a long time to reach vitamin D sufficiency, higher loading doses should not exceed 100 000 IU.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><br><strong>3. Vitamin D with calcium:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Treatment with Vitamin D must be always accompanied by adequate calcium supplements. One‐thousand milligrams of elementary calcium divided into two or three doses is sufficient in most cases. Higher amounts in the range of 2000 to 3000 mg daily are needed in patients with:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Malabsorption: After bariatric surgery or gastric bypass surgery, calcifediol (wherever available) can be utilized because it is a more polar metabolite that is absorbed via the portal system.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Hyperparathyroidism: The use of calcitriol along with Vitamin D may be preferred in these cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The use of another antiepileptic drug that does not interfere with vitamin D metabolism can be a choice.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="flexColumn container-fluid widget-container"><div class="flex"><div class="col-10"><div class="l5SemiBold">Did you know?</div><div class="smallRegular textSecondary">The calcium from food can only get absorbed when you have enough vitamin D in the body.

<h3 dir="ltr"><br><strong>1. Get adequate Vitamin D</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The body makes its own Vitamin D when bare skin is exposed to sunlight.

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Due to poor osteoid mineralization, several complications can occur if osteomalacia is left untreated. Symptoms can return if the deficiency of vitamin D and underlying conditions like kidney failure is not addressed. Here are some of the complications:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Insufficiency fractures, also known as looser zones, can present as bone pain and occur with little or no trauma in the legs.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Reports also exist of looser zones in the ribs, scapulae, and clavicles.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Researchers have also reported kyphoscoliosis (deviation and excessive curvature of the spine)in long-standing osteomalacia</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Also, in children, osteomalacia and <a href="https:///diseases/rickets-920?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Osteomalacia_complications_12_cta_link_0">rickets</a> often occur together, which can lead to bowing of the legs or premature tooth loss.</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">Spinal compression fractures are less common and are usually associated with osteoporosis.&nbsp;</p>

<strong><br></strong>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Octreotide therapy for tumor-induced osteomalacia</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Tumor-induced osteomalacia (also known as oncogenic osteomalacia) is a rare disorder characterized by phosphaturia (phosphorus in urine), hypophosphatemia (low levels of phosphorus in the blood), and osteomalacia. Tumor-induced osteomalacia develops because of tumors that are predominantly of benign origin4 but that may occasionally be malignant.<br><br>Surgical removal of the tumor may relieve all symptoms. Hemangiopericytoma (a type of rare tumor involving blood vessels and soft tissues)is the most common type of tumor-induced osteomalacia. Paraneoplastic secretion by the tumor of an unknown factor or factors termed “phosphatonins” that causes renal tubular phosphate wasting.<br><br><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa010839">Studies</a> have shown that subcutaneous administration of octreotide, a synthetic somatostatin analog, abolished renal tubular phosphate wasting before subsequent surgical removal of the tumor.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong><br>Phosphorus supplements</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Next to calcium, phosphorus is the most abundant mineral in the body. About 85% of the body's phosphorus is in bones and teeth. Phosphorus is also needed to help balance and use other vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin D, iodine, magnesium, and zinc.<br><br>Most people get plenty of phosphorus in their diets. The mineral is found in milk, grains, and protein-rich foods. Some of the inorganic phosphorus supplements include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Dibasic potassium phosphate</p>

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Osteomalacia is a disease that weakens bones and can cause them to break more easily. It is a disorder of decreased mineralization, which results in the breaking down of bone matrix faster than its re-formation. It may be several months before any bone pain and muscle weakness is relieved. You should continue taking vitamin D supplements regularly to prevent the condition from returning. Osteomalacia can be managed by:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Having a diet rich in Vitamin D and calcium</p>

<p dir="ltr">Osteoporosis literally means porous bone. This condition weakens bones and increases the risk of bone fractures.&nbsp;</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Individuals with osteoporosis do not have symptoms until bone fractures occur,&nbsp; hence the name, the silent disease of bone. These spontaneous fractures can cause severe back pain, loss of height, or malformations of the spine, like kyphosis (hunched posture).&nbsp;</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Osteoporosis is often seen in older women, usually in the menopausal age, due to decreased estrogen (a hormone responsible for female reproduction). Other significant risk factors include family history, lack of exercise, calcium and vitamin D deficiency, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and low body weight.</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">The diagnosis of osteoporosis is done by X-rays and confirmed by tests to measure bone density.</p>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">Treatment usually depends on the severity of the condition. Lifestyle modifications like strengthening exercises, Vitamin D and calcium supplements, quitting smoking, etc., are vital.

<p dir="ltr">Osteoporosis is also called a "silent" disease" because it has no specific clinical signs and symptoms unless there is a fracture. Spine fractures can induce severe back pain, loss of height, or spine deformities such as a stooped or hunched posture, also known as kyphosis. Bones affected by osteoporosis can become so fragile that fractures occur spontaneously or for the following reasons:</p>

<p dir="ltr">Normal bone turnover involves a balance between bone resorption and bone formation processes. In postmenopausal women, the rate of bone turnover increases dramatically and remains elevated after cessation of ovarian function, leading to continuous bone loss.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bones are strongest in early adulthood, and you slowly start losing bone from around the age of 35 years. This is a common phenomenon and happens to everyone. However, certain risk factors may increase the risk of the development of osteoporosis or can increase the likelihood that you will develop the disease.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="risk_factors" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Risk Factors For Osteoporosis</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr"><br>Osteoporosis may not show definite symptoms, but recurrent falls can indicate it, as osteoporosis may cause muscle weakness. The diagnosis consists of the following:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">
<strong>Screening and history</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Older adults at higher risk of osteoporosis must be screened periodically and evaluated for fracture risk. During regular check-ups, a patient's previous history of fractures due to falls, smoking, and alcohol intake details, menopausal status, and medication history must be taken and recorded.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Physical examination</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The physical examination must include height, weight, and body mass index to determine any loss of height. BMI less than <a href="https://biomedpharmajournal.org/vol14no2/diagnosis-screening-and-treatment-of-osteoporosis-a-review/">21 kg/m²</a> and loss of 5 cm or more are considered risk factors for osteoporosis. The presence of walking disorders, weakness, and postural instability increase the risk of fractures and falls.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Imaging tests</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Bone mineral density (BMD):</strong> This test gives a snapshot of bone health by estimating the amount of calcium and other minerals in bones. This is the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis, and it utilizes an x-ray, known as a DXA scan, especially in the hip and spine, to determine bone loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5335887/">T-Scores</a> and WHO diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Normal: </strong>1.0 and higher</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Osteopenia (loss of BMD):</strong> 1.0 to −2.5</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Osteoporosis:</strong> −2.5 and lower</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Severe osteoporosis:</strong> −2.5 and lower with one or more fragility fractures</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Early screening is vital</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Early screening can identify the risk factors for osteoporosis, which can help you make the right lifestyle changes to prevent it.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Bask in the sunlight</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Insufficient exposure to sunlight may be associated with many disorders, and getting sufficient and healthy sunlight helps strengthen teeth and bones, which in turn helps in preventing osteoporosis.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Optimize calcium and Vitamin D intake</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Calcium is essential for maintaining bone health. Vitamin D is vital for healthy bones and teeth as it aids in the absorption of calcium in the body. However, it can be hard to get enough from food alone. So, consider taking vitamin D and calcium supplements.<br><br></p>

<p dir="ltr"><br>If osteoporosis is detected early and treated, the outcomes are good. However, if the condition remains untreated, it can lead to chronic pain and fractures. Complications of osteoporosis include:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Recurrent falls:</strong> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00646/full">Studies</a> show that people with osteoporosis have a higher risk of falls due to muscle weakness, spine kyphosis, or decreased postural control.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Pathological fractures:</strong> These are the most severe complication of osteoporosis, particularly in the hip or spinal column.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Hip fractures often result from falls and can lead to disability and even increased mortality risk in the first following the injury.&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Vertebral fractures: These can cause kyphosis (hunchback), chronic pain, respiratory issues, and a high risk of developing <a href="https:///diseases/pneumonia-360?utm_medium=Osteoporosis_complications_12_cta_link_1&amp;utm_source=disease_page">pneumonia</a>.</li>

<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">The main aim of alternative therapies is to work with conventional treatment to provide relief. Always talk to your doctor before starting anything new. Alternative therapies that work best for osteoporosis include:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Massage therapy</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Massages can alleviate symptoms of osteoporosis, like pain and swelling, by relaxing your muscles. According to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770450/">study</a>, taking a massage, significantly Thai massage can help you to increase your bone formation.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Acupuncture</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Acupuncture is a therapy used in traditional Chinese medicine that involves placing very thin needles at strategic points on the body. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29614884/">Studies</a> show that acupuncture could be an effective therapy for treating osteoporosis as it promotes healing.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Tai chi</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Tai chi improves muscle strength and coordination and reduces muscle or joint pain and stiffness. This ancient Chinese practice uses a series of body postures that flow smoothly and gently from one to the next. However, there needs to be precise data available on the effectiveness of Tai chi for osteoporosis.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Melatonin therapy</strong></h3>
Melatonin is a hormone produced by the brain that is responsible for sleep. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979260/">Studies</a> have demonstrated that melatonin supplementation can improve perimenopausal- and age-related osteoporosis and avoid bone loss.</div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="living_with" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="col-12 marginTop-8"><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Living With Osteoporosis</strong></h2>
<strong><br></strong>
<p dir="ltr">You can lead an active and fulfilling life even if you have osteoporosis. All you need to do is make specific lifestyle changes. Tips that can help you if you are living with osteoporosis include:&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Prevent falls</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">The major complication of osteoporosis is fracturing due to falls. Things to keep in mind to prevent falls include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Wear shoes with non-slip bottoms</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Make sure there is nothing slippery on the floor</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Always grab bars in the bathrooms and railings on stairs</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Do not keep throw rugs and loose wires and cords lying around</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Always keep the lighting bright so that you can see well</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Use hip protectors</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is a different approach to the prevention of hip fractures. Hip protectors are rigid inserts used to prevent direct trauma to the hip. Hip protectors must be helpful in the bedridden elderly population.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Take extra care of broken bones</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Fractures usually take 6 to 8 weeks to heal, and osteoporosis does not affect how long this takes. Recovery depends on the type of fracture; while some fractures heal efficiently, others may require more intervention.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Note:</strong> You may need a physiotherapist's help to recover as much as possible.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Manage your pain</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Pain is subjective and different for every individual. Ways to manage pain include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Take pain medications</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Try warm baths or hot packs and cold packs</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr">Opt for relaxation techniques and hypnosis.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Abnormal vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, bloating, and constipation are common Stage III and IV symptoms of ovarian cancer. Some factors that could put various individuals at risk for this condition include age, family history, BRCA mutations, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and being childless.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Treatment and prognosis for ovarian cancer depend on the location of the tumor, its size, stage, spread, and overall health of the individual. Treatment usually combines debulking surgery with chemotherapy radiation, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, or even combinations of the above. Unfortunately, the prognosis is not so good in cases of ovarian cancer as they often present with late symptoms.</p></div></div></div><div style="background:#fafafa;display:block;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;height:16px"></div><div id="fact_box" class="style__dynamic-widget___39jlH"><div class="container-fluid widget-container"><div class="marginTop-8"><div class="col-12"><h2 class="l3Bold">Key Facts</h2></div><div class="flexColumn" id="factbox-expandable" style="max-height: 1066px; overflow: hidden;"><div class="marginTop-16"><div class="alignCenter flex"><div class="col-1 style__icon___36Jld"><div class=""></div></div><div class="bodyBold col-3">Usually seen in</div><div class="flexColumn col-8 style__textBreak___3IcLh"><div class="bodyRegular"><ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ovarian cancer has four types based on the cells from which it arises:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>1. Epithelial cell carcinomas</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Epithelial ovarian cancers, making up 85-90% of cases, originate from the ovary's surface, often spreading to the pelvis, abdomen, and beyond. Types of epithelial ovarian cancer include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC):</strong> These types of cancer spread at a faster rate and usually remain undiagnosed in the initial stages.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Endometrioid carcinoma:</strong> This type of cancer spreads to the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC): </strong>LGSOC spreads slowly and usually affects people at a younger age (between 45 and 57).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mucinous carcinoma:</strong> In this, tumor (mass of cells) is made up of cells coated in mucus.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC):</strong> This cancer is characterized by the presence of a pelvic mass which causes symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the ovary:</strong> They typically develop from noncancerous) conditions and respond well to treatment.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>2. Germ cell ovarian carcinoma</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">This type of cancer originates from the reproductive cells of the ovaries.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">This cancer is rarely observed and usually affects teenagers.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>3. Stromal cell ovarian cancer</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">These cancers arise from connective tissue cells of the ovaries.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">This type of cancer is often found in the early stages.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Vaginal bleeding is one of the most common symptoms of stromal cancer.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>4. Small cell carcinoma</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">It is an extremely rare ovarian cancer whose exact origin is still not known.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">It usually presents in younger females with features of <a href="https:///diseases/hypercalcemia-146?utm_source=disease_page&amp;utm_medium=Ovarian cancer_types_2_direct_link_0">hypercalcemia</a>.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Before knowing about the exact cause of ovarian cancer, it is important to understand the structure and function of ovaries.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>What are ovaries?</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Ovaries are the primary reproductive glands in females that produce eggs. Women have two ovaries located on each side of their uterus. The egg produced by the ovaries travels through the fallopian tube and fuses with the sperm. This fertilized egg travels further and settles in the uterus. The uterus nourishes the developing fetus prior to birth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ovaries also produce estrogen and progesterone – the two main reproductive hormones of the women.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The exact cause of ovarian cancer is not known. However, there are certain theories behind this which include:</p>
